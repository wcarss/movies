Box Office Optimizer
====================

This program will let you load in a file of this weekend's upcoming films and
adjust their numbers, comparing different setups for cost and projected total
revenue.

Something it does not do yet (but will in the future) is calculate the optimal
configuration of films, given the information you input. It also does not go
out to the internet and find projected revenues for the upcoming weekend,
but it would be pretty cool if it did that -- so it might get there.

It's likely going to change a great deal in terms of its interface (I'd like
it to actually be a website _and_ a command line utility) but for now it's
just a python-repl tool. It's meant to be run by invoking the python repl,
importing it, and then manually calling its functions.

If you have any questions (or for some reason think this merits a donation,
wink wink) please contact Wyatt Carss at carss.w@gmail.com

Enjoy!
